1.  Introduction

   Unencrypted communications have been historically designed for
   servers on local networks such as printers, routers, and SMB file
   sharing servers.  However, with the advent of HTTPS everywhere,
   browsers disadvantage unencrypted communications by requiring a
   secure context for features such as Service Workers, Web Bluetooth,
   WebCrypto, WebTransport, and more.  This increases the importance of
   a secure context to local domains.  Non-HTTP protocols such as SMB3
   encrypted file sharing would benefit from stronger server
   authentication and printing (IPP over HTTPS) would benefit from
   encrypted communications.

   Existing deployments of TLS and other encrypted protocols on local
   networks typically make use of so-called "self-signed" X.509
   certificates which lack the endorsement of a trusted third-party.  In
   addition, network devices are unable to determine the trustworthiness
   of the local network, humorous solutions such as the "evil bit" from
   "The Security Flag in the IPv4 Header" [RFC3514] aside.

   This document defines common terminology and the requirements for
   identifying, validating, and establishing secure connections with
   local network devices.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in "Key words for use in
   RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [RFC2119].

   Device:  (placeholder) Something that connects to network

   Client Device:  (placeholder) A Device that is used exclusively by
